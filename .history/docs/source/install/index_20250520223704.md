# Installation

The most complete and detailed installation process for AiiDA can be found in the official AiiDA documentation:
[Complete installation guide](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/stable/installation/guide_complete.html).

For a quick and easy setup, follow the steps below. This method is suitable for trying out AiiDA or for use cases where peak performance and all features (like the daemon for submitting calculations) are not immediately necessary.

## Easy Setup (Quick Install)

This method uses `pip` to install `aiida-core`, then `aiida-teros`, and finally the `verdi presto` command to quickly set up a default profile.

1.  **Install `aiida-core`**

    Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    pip install aiida-core
    ```
    AiiDA requires a recent version of Python. Please refer to the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/aiida-core/) for the minimum required version.

2.  **Install `aiida-teros`**

    Once `aiida-core` is installed, you can install `aiida-teros`:
    ```bash
    pip install aiida-teros
    ```
    Alternatively, if you have cloned the repository and want to install it in editable mode (e.g., for development):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/aiida-teros.git
    cd aiida-teros
    pip install -e .
    ```
    Replace `https://github.com/your-repo/aiida-teros.git` with the actual repository URL.

3.  **Set up a profile**

    After installing `aiida-core` and `aiida-teros`, you need to set up an AiiDA profile. A profile stores all your AiiDA data. The `verdi presto` command automates this for you:
    ```bash
    verdi presto
    ```
    This command will create a profile using SQLite for the database and will attempt to configure RabbitMQ if it's detected.

4.  **Verify the installation**

    Check if the installation was successful:
    ```bash
    verdi status
    ```
    If you see no red crosses in the output, your AiiDA installation is ready. The output will look something like this:
    ```
    ✔ version:     AiiDA vX.Y.Z
    ✔ config:      /path/to/.aiida
    ✔ profile:     presto_001 (default)
    ✔ storage:     SqliteDosStorage[/path/to/.aiida/repository/presto_001]: open
    ✔ broker:      RabbitMQ vA.B.C @ amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672?heartbeat=600  # or "not configured"
    ⏺ daemon:      The daemon is not running.
    ```

### Important Considerations for Quick Install

The `verdi presto` command sets up AiiDA with some defaults:
*   **Database**: By default, it uses SQLite. For production workloads requiring high-throughput, PostgreSQL is recommended. You can use `verdi presto --use-postgres` if you have PostgreSQL installed and accessible.
*   **Broker (RabbitMQ)**: `verdi presto` attempts to detect and configure RabbitMQ. If RabbitMQ is not found or configured, some AiiDA functionalities will be limited (e.g., running the daemon, submitting calculations with `submit()`, playing/pausing/killing processes).

For more details on these limitations and how to set up a feature-complete and performant installation (including PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ), please refer to the:
*   [Quick installation guide limitations](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/stable/installation/guide_quick.html#quick-install-limitations)
*   [Complete installation guide](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/stable/installation/guide_complete.html)

If you initially set up a profile without RabbitMQ, you can configure it later once RabbitMQ is available by running `verdi profile configure-rabbitmq`.
Similarly, for advanced database setup or other optional dependencies, consult the [complete installation guide](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/stable/installation/guide_complete.html).
