Coverage Bins Sampling - Results Summary
========================================

Test Structure: st2.vasp with 2×2×1 supercell

Reduction Pipeline:
-------------------
1. Original combinations: 6560 structures total
   - Vacancies: 255 combinations
   - Hydrogen: 255 combinations
   - Combined: 6050 combinations

2. After coverage deduplication: 44 structures (99.3% reduction)
   - Vacancies: 255 -> 8 unique coverages
   - Hydrogen: 255 -> 8 unique coverages
   - Combined: 6050 -> 28 unique coverage pairs

3. After bin sampling (5 bins): 35 structures (99.5% total reduction)
   - Vacancies: 8 -> 5 variants (5 bins)
   - Hydrogen: 8 -> 5 variants (5 bins)
   - Combined: 28 -> 25 variants (5×5 grid)

Performance:
------------
Total time for complete mode with 5 bins: 1.8 seconds
- Deduplication + binning + file I/O
- All processing in memory before writing

Verification:
-------------
- All 29 unit tests: PASS
- All 3 integration tests: PASS
- Coverage distribution: Even across 0-100% range
- Bin metadata: Present in all manifests

Example Output (Vacancies mode):
---------------------------------
Mode: vacancies. Wrote 5 variants to 'output/test_bins_vac'.
Deduplication: 255 generated -> 8 kept (removed 247 duplicates)
Binning: 8 unique -> 5 sampled (5 bins)

Bin Metadata in Manifest:
-------------------------
Each variant includes:
- bin_id: Integer bin identifier (0 to n_bins-1)
- bin_center: Coverage value at bin center
- For 2D (combined mode): bin_id_vac, bin_id_oh, bin_center_vac, bin_center_oh
