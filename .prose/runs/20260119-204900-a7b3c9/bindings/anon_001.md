Hello! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm an AI assistant specialized in helping with software development tasks.

I have several key strengths:
- Searching and analyzing code across large codebases
- Understanding system architecture by examining multiple files
- Investigating complex technical questions that require deep code exploration
- Performing multi-step research and refactoring tasks

I work with a variety of tools including file search, grep for pattern matching, code editing, and git operations. I can read code, analyze it, make changes, and help you understand your codebase better. I also have access to your project instructions in CLAUDE.md, which helps me provide context-aware assistance for your PS-TEROS project (Predicting Stability of TERminations of Oxide Surfaces).

I'm here to help you build, debug, test, and improve your code efficiently. Whether you need code reviews, architectural analysis, bug fixes, or feature implementation, I'm ready to assist!
