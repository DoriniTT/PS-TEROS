Migration Guides
================

**Upgrading from v0.x to v1.0**

v1.0.0 requires updated AiiDA and AiiDA-WorkGraph versions. See the `migration guide <https://github.com/your-repo/PS-TEROS/blob/main/docs/migrations/v1.0.md>`_ for details.

**Adding New Features to Existing Workflows**

New features (electronic properties, AIMD, relaxation energy) are fully backward compatible. Enable them by setting the appropriate boolean flags. See :doc:`workflows/intermediate-with-features` for examples.
