# Getting Started with Skills

## Critical Rules

1. **Use Read tool before announcing skill usage.** The session-start hook does NOT read 
skills for you. Announcing without calling Read = lying.

2. **Follow mandatory workflows.** Brainstorming before coding. Check for skills before ANY 
task.

3. **Create TodoWrite todos for checklists.** Mental tracking = steps get skipped. Every 
time.

## Mandatory Workflow 1: Brainstorming Before Coding

When your human partner wants to start a project, no matter how big or small:

**YOU MUST:**
1. Use Read tool: `${SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS_ROOT}/skills/collaboration/brainstorming/SKILL.md`
2. Wait for result
3. Follow what it says

**Don't:**
- Jump straight to code
- Wait for /brainstorm command
- Skip brainstorming because you "understand the idea"

**Why:** Jumping into implementation without understanding requirements wastes time. 
Requirements change, assumptions are wrong, and starting over is expensive. We always 
brainstorm first.

## Mandatory Workflow 2: Before ANY Task

**1. Check skills list** at session start, or run `find-skills [PATTERN]` to filter.

**2. Check if historical context would help** - See Workflow 3. If applicable, dispatch 
subagent to search past work.

**3. If relevant skill exists, YOU MUST use it:**

- Use Read tool with full path: 
`${SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS_ROOT}/skills/category/skill-name/SKILL.md`
- Read ENTIRE file, not just frontmatter
- Announce: "I've read [Skill Name] skill and I'm using it to [purpose]"
- Follow it exactly

**Don't rationalize:**
- "I remember this skill" - Skills evolve. Read the current version.
- "Session-start showed it to me" - That was using-skills/SKILL.md only. Read the actual 
skill.
- "This doesn't count as a task" - It counts. Find and read skills.

**Why:** Skills document proven techniques that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using 
available skills means repeating solved problems and making known errors.

Skills exist and you didn't use them = failed task.

## Workflow 3: Historical Context Search (Conditional)

**When:** Partner mentions past work, issue feels familiar, starting task in familiar domain,
 stuck/blocked, before reinventing

**When NOT:** Info in current convo, codebase state questions, first encounter, partner wants
 fresh thinking

**How (use subagent for 50-100x context savings):**
1. Dispatch subagent with template: `${SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS_ROOT}/skills/collaboration/remember
ing-conversations/tool/prompts/search-agent.md`
2. Receive synthesis (200-1000 words) + source pointers
3. Apply insights (never load raw .jsonl files)

**Why:** Past conversations contain context, decisions, and lessons learned. Loading raw 
files wastes 50-100x more context than using a subagent to synthesize.

**Red flags:** Reading .jsonl directly, pasting excerpts, asking "which conversation?", 
browsing archives

## Skills with Checklists

If a skill has a checklist, YOU MUST create TodoWrite todos for EACH item.

**Don't:**
- Work through checklist mentally
- Skip creating todos "to save time"
- Batch multiple items into one todo
- Mark complete without doing them

**Why:** Checklists without TodoWrite tracking = steps get skipped. Every time. The overhead 
of TodoWrite is tiny compared to the cost of missing steps.

**Examples:** skills/testing/test-driven-development/SKILL.md, 
skills/debugging/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md, skills/meta/writing-skills/SKILL.md

## Announcing Skill Usage

After you've read a skill with Read tool, announce you're using it:

"I've read the [Skill Name] skill and I'm using it to [what you're doing]."

**Examples:**
- "I've read the Brainstorming skill and I'm using it to refine your idea into a design."
- "I've read the Test-Driven Development skill and I'm using it to implement this feature."
- "I've read the Systematic Debugging skill and I'm using it to find the root cause."

**Why:** Transparency helps your human partner understand your process and catch errors 
early. It also confirms you actually read the skill.

## How to Read a Skill

Every skill has the same structure:

1. **Frontmatter** - `when_to_use` tells you if this skill matches your situation
2. **Overview** - Core principle in 1-2 sentences
3. **Quick Reference** - Scan for your specific pattern
4. **Implementation** - Full details and examples
5. **Supporting files** - Load only when implementing

**Many skills contain rigid rules (TDD, debugging, verification).** Follow them exactly. 
Don't adapt away the discipline.

**Some skills are flexible patterns (architecture, naming).** Adapt core principles to your 
context.

The skill itself tells you which type it is.

## Instructions ≠ Permission to Skip Workflows

Your human partner's specific instructions describe WHAT to do, not HOW.

"Add X", "Fix Y" = the goal, NOT permission to skip brainstorming, TDD, or 
RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.

**Red flags:** "Instruction was specific" • "Seems simple" • "Workflow is overkill"

**Why:** Specific instructions mean clear requirements, which is when workflows matter MOST. 
Skipping process on "simple" tasks is how simple tasks become complex problems.

## Writing Skills

Want to document a technique, pattern, or tool for reuse?

See skills/meta/writing-skills/SKILL.md for the complete TDD process for documentation.

## Summary

**Starting conversation?** You just read using-skills/SKILL.md. Good.

**Starting any task:**
1. Run find-skills to check for relevant skills
2. If relevant skill exists → Use Read tool with full path (includes /SKILL.md)
3. Announce you're using it
4. Follow what it says

**Skill has checklist?** TodoWrite for every item.

**Finding a relevant skill = mandatory to read and use it. Not optional.**


**Tool paths (use these when you need to search for or run skills):**
- find-skills: /home/thiagotd/.config/superpowers/skills/skills/using-skills/find-skills
- skill-run: /home/thiagotd/.config/superpowers/skills/skills/using-skills/skill-run

**Skills live in:** /home/thiagotd/.config/superpowers/skills/skills/ (you work on your own 
branch and can edit any skill)

**Available skills (output of find-skills):**

● We have another socket-related error. The builder pattern still can't accept socket outputs
   directly. Let me examine how other tasks in the workgraph connect their inputs:

● Read(~/git/PS-TEROS/.worktree/feature-dos-bands/teros/core/workgraph.py)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

● I see the issue - we can't assign socket outputs to builder attributes. When connecting
  task outputs (sockets) to other task inputs in WorkGraph, we need to pass them directly as
  kwargs to wg.add_task(), not through a builder.

  Let me fix this by abandoning the builder approach and passing inputs directly:

● We're still hitting namespace errors. Let me check the user's working script to see how
  they correctly set up the BandsWorkChain:

● Read(~/git/unicamp_posdoc/coding/AiiDA/BUILDERS/VASP/0.5.2/vasp_builders_BANDS.py)
  ⎿  Read 150 lines

● I see the issue! In the working script, they use the builder pattern but they're NOT in a
  WorkGraph context - they're submitting directly. The builder sets nested namespaces like
  builder.scf.code, builder.bands.code, etc.

  The problem is that when adding a task to WorkGraph with sockets, we can't use the builder
  pattern because sockets can't be assigned to builder attributes. We also can't use flat
  kwargs because BandsWorkChain has nested namespaces.

  Let me try passing inputs as a properly nested dictionary structure:

  3. Called the task directly instead of using wg.add_task()

● The error is about 'name' - that's because name is a parameter for adding the task to the

  the workgraph using wg.add_task():

● We're still hitting the same error. This suggests that wrapping BandsWorkChain with task()
  doesn't automatically expose its inputs the way we expect. Let me check if there are any
  aiida-workgraph examples or documentation about using VASP workchains:

● Web Search("aiida-workgraph vasp workchain example")
  ⎿  Did 6 searches in 52s                                                                  

● The search results show that WorkGraph should automatically handle WorkChain inputs, but
  perhaps I need to wrap string inputs in AiiDA types. Let me try wrapping potential_family
  and potential_mapping properly:

● Let me test this now with all inputs properly wrapped in AiiDA types:

● I think I may have misunderstood the BandsWorkChain input structure. Let me check the
  AiiDA-VASP source code or documentation more carefully about the actual input spec for
  BandsWorkChain:

● Fetch(https://aiida-vasp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workchains/bands.html)
  ⎿  Received 23.5KB (200 OK)

● The documentation confirms code should be a root-level input. This suggests the task
  wrapping might be the issue. Let me try passing the raw WorkChain class directly without
  wrapping it with task():

● Update(~/git/PS-TEROS/.worktree/feature-dos-bands/teros/core/workgraph.py)
  ⎿  Updated ../../teros/core/workgraph.py with 1 addition and 2 removals
