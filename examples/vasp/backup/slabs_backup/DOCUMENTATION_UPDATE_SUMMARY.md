# Documentation Update Summary

## Overview

All documentation files in `examples/slabs/` have been updated to reflect the correct implementation of the user-provided slabs feature.

## What Was Corrected

### Key Issue Fixed

The original documentation described passing StructureData nodes directly through `@task.graph().build()` parameters, which causes provenance cycle errors. The actual working implementation uses:

1. A `use_input_slabs` boolean flag passed to `core_workgraph()`
2. Post-build manual injection of the `relax_slabs_scatter` task
3. Direct assignment of stored structures as task inputs

### Critical Addition

**All examples now emphasize**: User structures MUST be stored (`.store()`) before being added to the `input_slabs` dictionary.

## Files Updated

### 1. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` ✅
**Changes**:
- Updated implementation description to reflect actual code
- Added explanation of `use_input_slabs` flag
- Documented post-build injection approach
- Explained why this approach is necessary (provenance cycles)
- Added note about `.store()` requirement
- Updated code examples

**Key Sections Modified**:
- "What Was Changed" - Now describes actual implementation
- "Implementation Code" - Shows real code with flag and post-build injection
- "Why This Approach?" - New section explaining constraints
- "Known Limitations" - Added structure storage requirement

### 2. `README_INPUT_SLABS.md` ✅
**Changes**:
- Updated "Load Structures in Your Script" section
- Added `.store()` call to all code examples
- Emphasized storage requirement with **CRITICAL** marker
- Updated code samples throughout

**Key Sections Modified**:
- Section 2 "Load Structures in Your Script" - Added `.store()` calls
- All code examples now include storage step

### 3. `QUICKSTART.md` ✅
**Changes**:
- Updated Step 2 to include `.store()` call
- Updated all pattern examples to store structures
- Added "Must store!" comments to code
- Updated minimal example

**Key Sections Modified**:
- Step 2 - Added storage requirement
- Pattern 1, 2, 3 - All updated with `.store()` calls
- Complete Minimal Example - Shows proper structure storage

### 4. `README.md` ✅
**Changes**:
- Updated "Mode 2: User-Provided Slabs" example
- Added `.store()` call with comment
- Made example more explicit

**Key Sections Modified**:
- "Two Ways to Work with Slabs" section - Mode 2 example updated

### 5. `IMPORTANT_NOTES.md` ✅ (NEW)
**Created**: Comprehensive notes document covering:
- Critical requirement to store structures
- Why it's required
- How the implementation works internally
- Verification steps
- Common issues and solutions
- Best practices
- Architecture explanation
- Version information

## Verification

All documentation now:
- ✅ Correctly describes the actual implementation
- ✅ Emphasizes the `.store()` requirement
- ✅ Shows accurate code examples
- ✅ Explains the post-build injection approach
- ✅ Addresses provenance cycle issues
- ✅ Provides troubleshooting guidance

## Quick Reference

### Correct Usage Pattern

```python
from aiida import load_profile, orm
from ase.io import read
from teros.core.workgraph import build_core_workgraph_with_map

load_profile()

# Load and store slabs
input_slabs = {}
for idx, filename in enumerate(["slab_0.cif", "slab_1.cif"]):
    structure = orm.StructureData(ase=read(filename))
    structure.store()  # CRITICAL: Must store!
    input_slabs[f"term_{idx}"] = structure

# Build workflow
wg = build_core_workgraph_with_map(
    ...,  # other parameters
    input_slabs=input_slabs,
    relax_slabs=True,
)

wg.submit()
```

## Documentation Files Status

| File | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `README.md` | ✅ Updated | Main directory guide |
| `QUICKSTART.md` | ✅ Updated | 5-minute guide |
| `README_INPUT_SLABS.md` | ✅ Updated | Comprehensive user guide |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | ✅ Updated | Technical implementation |
| `IMPORTANT_NOTES.md` | ✅ Created | Critical usage notes |
| `TEST_REPORT.md` | ℹ️ Existing | Test results (unchanged) |
| `input_structures/README.md` | ℹ️ Existing | Input directory guide (unchanged) |

## Key Messages

1. **Always store structures**: Call `.store()` before adding to `input_slabs`
2. **Implementation works**: Post-build injection successfully avoids provenance cycles
3. **Verification**: Check that no `generate_slab_structures` task is called
4. **Documentation accurate**: All examples now show correct implementation

## Testing Recommendations

After reading the documentation, users should:

1. Verify the feature works by running `slabs_input_relax.py`
2. Check workflow execution shows their input slab PKs
3. Confirm no slab generation task is called
4. Validate that relaxed structures match input structures

## Version

- Documentation updated: 2025-10-08
- PS-TEROS version: v0.2.0
- Feature: User-provided slabs (manual slab input)

---

**Summary**: All documentation now accurately describes the working implementation, emphasizes critical requirements, and provides correct usage examples.
