# Merge Summary: Relaxation Energy Module

## Merge Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Feature Branch**: `feature-relax-energy`  
**Target Branch**: `develop`  
**Merge Commit**: 8d880ad

## Summary

Successfully merged the relaxation energy calculation module into the `develop` branch. This feature adds optional calculation of relaxation energies for slab terminations, quantifying the energetic stabilization from atomic relaxation at surfaces.

## What Was Merged

### Core Implementation (2 files)
- `teros/core/slabs.py` (+241 lines)
  - `scf_slabs_scatter()` - SCF workgraph
  - `calculate_relaxation_energies_scatter()` - Energy calculation workgraph
  - `calculate_energy_difference()` - Helper calcfunction
  - `scf_relax_and_calculate_relaxation_energy()` - Combined approach

- `teros/core/workgraph.py` (+79 lines, -5 lines)
  - Added `compute_relaxation_energy` parameter
  - Conditional SCF and energy calculation workgraphs
  - Updated documentation

### Examples (3 files)
- `examples/slabs/ag2o_100_relaxation_energy.py` - Working example
- `examples/slabs/monitor_relaxation_energy.py` - Monitoring script
- `examples/slabs/README_RELAXATION_ENERGY.md` - Example docs

### Documentation (6 files)
- `docs/RELAXATION_ENERGY.md` - User guide
- `QUICKSTART_RELAXATION_ENERGY.md` - Quick start
- `RELAXATION_ENERGY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical details
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS.md` - Test results
- `IMPLEMENTATION_FIXED.md` - Issue resolution
- `VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md` - Verification report

### Changelog
- `CHANGE.md` - Updated with feature description

## Total Changes
- **12 files changed**
- **2,457 insertions**
- **5 deletions**

## Key Features

✅ **Optional**: Controlled by `compute_relaxation_energy=False` (default)  
✅ **Three Workgraphs**: SCF, Relaxation, Energy calculation  
✅ **Backward Compatible**: No changes to existing behavior  
✅ **Parallel Execution**: Scatter-gather pattern  
✅ **Tested**: Verified with Ag2O (100) surface  
✅ **Documented**: Complete user guide and examples  

## Merge Process

1. ✅ Feature committed in `feature-relax-energy`
2. ✅ Changes pushed to remote
3. ✅ Switched to `develop` branch
4. ✅ Pulled latest changes
5. ✅ Merged with `--no-ff` flag
6. ✅ **No conflicts** encountered
7. ✅ Pushed to remote `develop`

## Merge Command Used

```bash
cd /home/thiagotd/git/PS-TEROS
git checkout develop
git pull
git merge feature-relax-energy --no-ff -m "Merge feature-relax-energy: Add optional relaxation energy calculation module"
git push
```

## Verification

The feature was fully tested before merging:
- **Test Workflow PK**: 25230
- **Status**: Finished [0] (success)
- **Results**: Relaxation energies calculated correctly
  - term_0: -1.009 eV
  - term_1: -2.056 eV

## Usage in Develop Branch

Users can now enable relaxation energy calculation:

```python
from teros.core.workgraph import build_core_workgraph

wg = build_core_workgraph(
    # ... parameters ...
    relax_slabs=True,
    compute_relaxation_energy=True,  # NEW optional parameter
)
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Feature branch merged into `develop`
2. ⏳ Test in `develop` branch to confirm integration
3. ⏳ Eventually merge `develop` into `main` for release
4. ℹ️ Feature branch `feature-relax-energy` kept for reference (as per guidelines)

## Notes

- Merge was clean with no conflicts
- All tests passed before merging
- Documentation is complete
- Feature is backward compatible
- Default behavior unchanged
