```
================================================================================
WORKGRAPH PK: 24573
================================================================================
```

## Workflow Structure

The submitted workgraph contains **15 tasks**:
1. Bulk Ag2O relaxation (VaspWorkChain)
2. Metal (Ag) reference relaxation (VaspWorkChain)  
3. Oxygen (O2) reference relaxation (VaspWorkChain)
4. Nonmetal reference relaxation (VaspWorkChain - dummy for binary oxide)
5. Formation enthalpy calculation
6. Slab structure generation
7. **SCF calculations on unrelaxed slabs** (scf_slabs_scatter) - NEW!
8. **Slab relaxations** (relax_slabs_scatter)
9. **Relaxation energy calculations** (calculate_relaxation_energies_scatter) - NEW!
10-15. Additional tasks for energy extraction and data management

## Verification Steps

### 1. Script Execution ✅
```bash
$ python ag2o_100_relaxation_energy.py
```
- **Result**: Script ran without errors
- **Output**: Workgraph created and submitted
- **PK**: 24573

### 2. Workflow Submission ✅
```
✓ WorkGraph submitted successfully!
WORKGRAPH PK: 24573
```

### 3. Initial Status Check ✅
```bash
$ verdi process show 24573
```
- **State**: Waiting
- **Tasks**: 15 tasks created
- **Called Processes**: 4 VASP calculations started (bulk + 3 references)

### 4. Daemon Status ✅
```bash
$ verdi daemon status
```
- **Daemon**: Running (PID 4134353)
- **Workers**: 1 active worker
- **Load**: 4% of available slots (healthy)

### 5. Process Queue ✅
```bash
$ verdi process list
```
All processes are running:
- WorkGraph (PK 24573): Waiting for children
- VaspWorkChain tasks (4): All submitted and waiting

## Expected Workflow Execution

The workflow will proceed through these phases:

### Phase 1: Reference Calculations (Current)
- ✅ Bulk Ag2O relaxation
- ✅ Metal (Ag) relaxation
- ✅ Oxygen (O2) relaxation
- Status: **Running** (in queue)

### Phase 2: Slab Generation
- Generate slab terminations from relaxed bulk
- Status: **Pending** (waiting for Phase 1)

### Phase 3: SCF Calculations (NEW FEATURE)
- Run SCF on each unrelaxed slab (NSW=0, IBRION=-1)
- Output: `unrelaxed_slab_energies`
- Status: **Pending** (waiting for Phase 2)

### Phase 4: Slab Relaxation
- Relax each slab structure
- Output: `relaxed_slabs`, `slab_energies`
- Status: **Pending** (waiting for Phase 3)

### Phase 5: Relaxation Energy Calculation (NEW FEATURE)
- Calculate E_relax = E_relaxed - E_unrelaxed
- Output: `relaxation_energies`
- Status: **Pending** (waiting for Phase 4)

## New Features Verified

### ✅ SCF Calculation Task
- Function: `scf_slabs_scatter()` in `teros/core/slabs.py`
- **Verified**: Task appears in workgraph structure
- **Verified**: Correct inputs (slabs, code, parameters)
- **Verified**: NSW=0 and IBRION=-1 set automatically

### ✅ Relaxation Energy Calculation Task
- Function: `calculate_relaxation_energies_scatter()` in `teros/core/slabs.py`
- **Verified**: Task appears in workgraph structure
- **Verified**: Correct inputs (unrelaxed_energies, relaxed_energies)

### ✅ Integration with Workflow
- **Verified**: Tasks added to `core_workgraph` outputs
- **Verified**: Proper task dependencies (SCF → Relax → Calculate)
- **Verified**: No errors during workgraph building

## Monitoring

### Check Progress
```bash
# Current status
verdi process show 24573

# Watch in real-time
watch -n 5 'verdi process show 24573'

# Check report
verdi process report 24573

# Monitor with Python
python monitor_relaxation_energy.py 24573
```

### Expected Completion Time
Based on system parameters:
- Bulk + references: ~30 minutes
- Slab generation: <1 minute
- SCF per slab: ~5-10 minutes (per slab, parallel)
- Relaxation per slab: ~30-60 minutes (per slab, parallel)

**Total**: ~1-2 hours for complete workflow

## Results Access (After Completion)

Once the workflow completes successfully:

```python
from aiida import orm

# Load the workgraph
node = orm.load_node(24573)

# Check if finished
print(f"State: {node.process_state.value}")

# Access relaxation energies
if node.is_finished_ok:
    print("\nRelaxation Energies:")
    print("-" * 40)
    for label, energy in node.outputs.relaxation_energies.items():
        print(f"  {label}: {energy.value:+.4f} eV")
```
