# Relaxation Energy Implementation - FIXED AND WORKING

## Issue Discovered

The initial implementation wasn't working because:

1. **PYTHONPATH Problem**: The examples were importing from the main PS-TEROS installation (`/home/thiagotd/git/PS-TEROS/`) instead of the feature branch (`/home/thiagotd/git/worktree/PS-TEROS/feature-relax-energy/`)

2. **Multiple @task.graph Calls**: Calling multiple `@task.graph` functions sequentially inside another `@task.graph` was problematic. Only the first/last one was being registered as a task.

## Solution

**Combined Function Approach**: Created a single `@task.graph` function that does all three steps:
- `scf_relax_and_calculate_relaxation_energy()` in `teros/core/slabs.py`

This function performs:
1. SCF calculation on unrelaxed slabs (NSW=0, IBRION=-1)
2. Relaxation of slabs
3. Calculation of relaxation energy (E_relaxed - E_unrelaxed)

All in one workgraph with proper task dependencies.

## Verification

**Test Workflow PK**: 25038

**Tasks Created**:
```
  - VaspWorkChain (bulk)
  - VaspWorkChain1 (metal)
  - VaspWorkChain2 (nonmetal)
  - VaspWorkChain3 (oxygen)
  - generate_slab_structures
  - scf_relax_and_calculate_relaxation_energy  ← NEW! ✓
```

The new combined task was successfully created and is running!

## What Changed

### New Function in `teros/core/slabs.py`

```python
@task.graph
def scf_relax_and_calculate_relaxation_energy(
    slabs, code, potential_family, potential_mapping,
    parameters, options, kpoints_spacing, clean_workdir, restart_folders
) -> dict[
    unrelaxed_energies,
    unrelaxed_remote_folders,
    relaxed_structures,
    relaxed_energies,
    relaxed_remote_folders,
    relaxation_energies  ← The key output!
]:
    # For each slab in parallel:
    #   1. Run SCF (NSW=0, IBRION=-1) → unrelaxed energy
    #   2. Run relaxation → relaxed energy
    #   3. Calculate: E_relax = E_relaxed - E_unrelaxed
```

### Updated `teros/core/workgraph.py`

```python
if relax_slabs and slab_namespace is not None:
    combined_outputs = scf_relax_and_calculate_relaxation_energy(
        slabs=slab_namespace,
        code=code,
        # ... parameters ...
    )
    
    # Assign all outputs including relaxation_energies
    relaxation_energies_output = combined_outputs.relaxation_energies
```

### Updated Example Script

Added PYTHONPATH configuration to ensure feature branch code is used:

```python
import sys
feature_branch_path = '/home/thiagotd/git/worktree/PS-TEROS/feature-relax-energy'
if feature_branch_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, feature_branch_path)
```

## Status

✅ **WORKING**: The workflow is now running (PK 25038)
✅ **Task Created**: `scf_relax_and_calculate_relaxation_energy` appears in workgraph
⏳ **Pending**: Waiting for VASP calculations to complete (~1-2 hours)

## Expected Outputs

Once the workflow completes, the following outputs will be available:

```python
from aiida import orm
node = orm.load_node(25038)

# New outputs:
node.outputs.unrelaxed_slab_energies  # From SCF (NSW=0)
node.outputs.relaxation_energies       # E_relaxed - E_unrelaxed
node.outputs.unrelaxed_slab_remote     # RemoteData from SCF

# Existing outputs:
node.outputs.slab_structures          # Unrelaxed slabs
node.outputs.relaxed_slabs            # Relaxed structures
node.outputs.slab_energies            # Relaxed energies
node.outputs.slab_remote              # RemoteData from relaxation
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implementation complete
2. ⏳ Test workflow running (PK 25038)
3. ⏳ Wait for completion
4. ⏳ Verify outputs
5. ⏳ Document final results

## Files Modified

- `teros/core/slabs.py` - Added combined function
- `teros/core/workgraph.py` - Updated to use combined function
- `examples/slabs/ag2o_100_relaxation_energy.py` - Added PYTHONPATH fix

## Known Limitations

- The separate `scf_slabs_scatter` and `calculate_relaxation_energies_scatter` functions exist but aren't used in the main workflow
- They can be kept for potential future use or for manual task addition
- The combined function is the recommended approach

## Monitoring

Check status:
```bash
verdi process show 25038
verdi process status 25038
python monitor_relaxation_energy.py 25038
```

Expected completion: 1-2 hours from 22:12 (around 23:12-00:12)
