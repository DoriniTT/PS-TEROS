# Bug Fix Summary - AiiDA-VASP BandsWorkChain DOS Output Issue

## Date: 2025-10-12

## Problem

The AiiDA-VASP `BandsWorkChain` (v2) had a bug where it attempted to access `dos.outputs.dos` from the DOS VaspWorkChain, but VaspWorkChain always outputs 'bands' regardless of whether it's computing band structure or DOS.

### Error Message
```
KeyError: 'dos'
...
aiida.common.exceptions.NotExistentAttributeError: Node<29437> does not have an output with link label 'dos'
```

### Root Cause
In `/home/thiagotd/envs/aiida/lib/python3.13/site-packages/aiida_vasp/workchains/v2/bands.py`, line 533:

```python
self.out('dos', dos.outputs.dos)  # ❌ dos.outputs.dos doesn't exist
```

The DOS calculation (which is a VaspWorkChain) outputs its result as 'bands', not 'dos', because VASP outputs DOS data in the same format as band structure data (in EIGENVAL/vasprun.xml).

## Solution

### File Modified
`/home/thiagotd/envs/aiida/lib/python3.13/site-packages/aiida_vasp/workchains/v2/bands.py`

### Backup Created
```bash
/home/thiagotd/envs/aiida/lib/python3.13/site-packages/aiida_vasp/workchains/v2/bands.py.backup_20251012_094444
```

### Fix Applied
Changed line 533 from:
```python
self.out('dos', dos.outputs.dos)
```

To:
```python
# FIX: VaspWorkChain outputs 'bands' for DOS calculations, not 'dos'
self.out('dos', dos.outputs.bands)
```

## Verification

### Test Run Results
- **WorkGraph PK:** 30061
- **BandsWorkChain PK:** 30125
- **Status:** ✅ Finished [0] (Success!)

### Workflow Completion
```
2025-10-12 09:55:04 [12215 | REPORT]: [30061|WorkGraphEngine|update_task_state]: 
Task: BandsWorkChain_bulk, type: WORKCHAIN, finished.
```

The BandsWorkChain now successfully:
1. ✅ Completes SCF calculation
2. ✅ Completes band structure calculation
3. ✅ Completes DOS calculation
4. ✅ Properly exposes both 'band_structure' and 'dos' outputs

## Additional Fix: Cleavage Calculation

The example script was also triggering an error about missing slab inputs for cleavage calculations. Since the example is only for bulk electronic properties, we added:

```python
compute_cleavage=False,  # Disable slab-related calculations
```

to the `build_core_workgraph()` call in `bulk_dos_bands_ag2o.py`.

## Impact

### Who Is Affected
- Anyone using AiiDA-VASP's `vasp.v2.bands` workchain with DOS calculations
- The bug occurs when `run_dos=True` in band_settings

### Environments Fixed
- ✅ `/home/thiagotd/envs/aiida/` (Python 3.13) - **PRIMARY** (daemon runs here)
- ⚠️  `/home/thiagotd/envs/psteros/` (Python 3.10) - Not fixed (but not used by daemon)

**Note:** Only the `aiida` environment needs to be fixed because that's where the AiiDA daemon runs workchains.

## Files Changed

### 1. AiiDA-VASP Plugin (Bug Fix)
```
File: /home/thiagotd/envs/aiida/lib/python3.13/site-packages/aiida_vasp/workchains/v2/bands.py
Backup: bands.py.backup_20251012_094444
Change: Line 533 - dos.outputs.dos → dos.outputs.bands
```

### 2. PS-TEROS Example Script (Configuration Fix)
```
File: examples/electronic_properties/bulk_dos_bands_ag2o.py
Change: Added compute_cleavage=False flag
```

### 3. PS-TEROS Builder (No changes needed)
```
File: teros/core/builders/electronic_properties_builder.py
Backup: electronic_properties_builder.py.backup_20251012_094513
Note: ISMEAR=0 is fine for DOS with Gaussian smearing; ISMEAR=-5 is alternative
```

## Testing

### Successful Test Run
```bash
cd /home/thiagotd/git/PS-TEROS/.worktree/feature-dos-bands/examples/electronic_properties
source ~/envs/psteros/bin/activate
python bulk_dos_bands_ag2o.py
```

Results:
- WorkGraph submitted successfully
- All three reference calculations completed (bulk, metal, oxygen)
- BandsWorkChain completed successfully:
  - SCF calculation: ✅
  - Band structure calculation: ✅
  - DOS calculation: ✅
- Outputs exposed correctly:
  - `bulk_bands` (band_structure)
  - `bulk_dos` (DOS data)
  - `bulk_electronic_properties_misc` (seekpath_parameters)

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check workflow status
verdi process show 30061

# Check BandsWorkChain
verdi process show 30125

# View the outputs
verdi shell
>>> from aiida.orm import load_node
>>> wg = load_node(30061)
>>> print(wg.outputs.bulk_bands)  # Should show BandsData
>>> print(wg.outputs.bulk_dos)    # Should show BandsData (DOS)
```

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert the changes:

```bash
# Restore original bands.py
cp /home/thiagotd/envs/aiida/lib/python3.13/site-packages/aiida_vasp/workchains/v2/bands.py.backup_20251012_094444 \
   /home/thiagotd/envs/aiida/lib/python3.13/site-packages/aiida_vasp/workchains/v2/bands.py

# Restore original builder

# Restart daemon
verdi daemon restart
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Report to AiiDA-VASP Team
This is a genuine bug in aiida-vasp. Consider reporting it:
- Repository: https://github.com/aiida-vasp/aiida-vasp
- Issue: "BandsWorkChain incorrectly accesses dos.outputs.dos instead of dos.outputs.bands"

### 2. Document the Workaround
Until the official fix is released, document this fix in your installation notes.

### 3. Check Other Environments
If you have other conda/virtual environments with aiida-vasp, they may need the same fix.

### 4. Monitor Updates
Watch for aiida-vasp updates that might include this fix, and verify the fix persists after updates.

## Technical Details

### Why VaspWorkChain Outputs 'bands' for DOS

VASP writes both band structure and DOS data to similar files (EIGENVAL, DOSCAR, vasprun.xml). The aiida-vasp VaspWorkChain parser creates a `BandsData` object from these files regardless of whether it's a band structure or DOS calculation. The difference is in:

- **Band structure**: BandsData with k-points along high-symmetry paths
- **DOS**: BandsData with k-points on a uniform mesh

Both are stored as 'bands' output in VaspWorkChain. The BandsWorkChain is responsible for renaming the DOS output appropriately.

### The Fix Logic

```python
if 'dos_workchain' in self.ctx:
    dos = self.ctx.dos_workchain
    # DOS VaspWorkChain outputs 'bands', not 'dos'
    # We expose it as 'dos' for clarity
    self.out('dos', dos.outputs.bands)  # ✅ Correct
```

This correctly maps:
- `dos_workchain.outputs.bands` → `BandsWorkChain.outputs.dos`

## Status

✅ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

The electronic properties feature is now fully functional and tested.
