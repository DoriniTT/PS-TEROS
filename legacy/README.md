## Introduction

Welcome to the **AiiDA-TEROS** repository!

**TEROS** stands for **Thermodynamics of Oxide Surfaces**, and this project is dedicated to automating the study of surface thermodynamics for oxide materials using the powerful combination of [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/) and [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/).

Understanding the thermodynamic properties of oxide surfaces is crucial in fields such as catalysis, corrosion science, and materials engineering. Oxide surfaces often exhibit complex behaviors due to their interactions with the environment, especially in the presence of oxygen and under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Traditional computational studies of these systems can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, requiring significant manual setup and data handling.

**AiiDA-TEROS** addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive and fully automated workflow that streamlines the entire processâ€”from pre-processing and calculations to post-processing and analysis. By leveraging AiiDA's workflow management capabilities and VASP's robust computational engine, researchers can focus on interpreting results rather than managing computational tasks.

---

## Usage

The AiiDA-TEROS workflow consists of three main input files:

1. **AiiDA_teros.py**: Defines the AiiDA-TEROS class, implementing the workflow.
2. **run_aiida.py**: Submission script to run AiiDA-TEROS with user-defined inputs.
3. **config.yaml**: Configuration file containing all input parameters for the workflow.

### 1. Preparing Input Files

- **Bulk Structure File**: Prepare a bulk structure file in VASP POSCAR format (e.g., `bulk_structure.vasp`). Place it in the same directory as the main Python scripts.

- **Configuration File**: The `config.yaml` file contains all the necessary parameters for the workflow. Here is an overview of the sections in `config.yaml`:

  - **Paths and File Names**: Defines the bulk structure path, potential family, and code label.
  - **Thermodynamic Parameters**: Enthalpy of formation for bulk oxide.
  - **Total Energies**: Total energies for individual elements (only necessary for ternary oxides).
  - **INCAR Parameters**: Parameters for both bulk and slab relaxations.
  - **Workflow Settings**: Settings related to k-point precision.
  - **Potential Mapping**: Mapping for each element to its corresponding pseudopotential.
  - **Parser Settings**: Settings for parsing the output.
  - **Computer Options**: Computational resource settings such as number of machines and cores.
  - **Slab Generation Parameters**: Parameters for slab generation, such as Miller indices and slab thickness.
  - **Terminations**: Specifies the surface terminations to be calculated. If provided, these terminations will be used instead of generating them automatically.

### 2. Submitting and Running the WorkChain

To run the workflow, use the `run_aiida.py` script. This script reads input parameters from `config.yaml` and submits the workflow to AiiDA.

The `run_aiida.py` script performs the following actions:

- Loads the configuration from `config.yaml`.
- Extracts all relevant parameters, such as paths, INCAR settings, and computational resources.
- Loads the bulk structure and prepares it as an AiiDA [`StructureData`](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/topics/data_types.html#structuredata) node.
- Sets up all the necessary inputs for the AiiDA-TEROS workflow.
- Submits the work chain to the AiiDA daemon for execution.
- Ensures the AiiDA daemon is running, and writes the process ID (PK) to `pks.txt` for future reference.

To execute the submission script:

```bash
verdi daemon restart
python run_aiida.py
```

### 3. Monitoring and Retrieving Results

- **Monitor the WorkChain**

  Use AiiDA's command-line tools to monitor the progress:

  ```bash
  verdi process list      # List running processes
  verdi process show PK   # Show details of the process with ID PK
  ```

- **Retrieve Outputs**

  Upon completion, the workflow generates outputs including:

  - Relaxed bulk and slab structures.
  - Surface Gibbs free energies and phase diagrams.
  - Plots saved in the specified directory (`thermo_results/binary` or `thermo_results/ternary`).
  - LaTeX tables with the parameters used for calculating surface Gibbs free energies for binary and ternary oxides.

- **Visualize Results**

  The generated plots can be found in the appropriate subdirectory (`thermo_results/binary` or `thermo_results/ternary`). These include:

  - **surface_free_energies.pdf**
  - **termination_parameters_table.tex** (for binary and ternary oxides)

## Output Explanation

The **AiiDA-TEROS** workflow generates several key outputs organized into categories. These outputs include relaxed structures and associated data, essential for further thermodynamic analysis. Below is an overview:

### 1. Bulk Relaxation

Outputs from the relaxation of the bulk structure:

- **structure** (`StructureData`): The relaxed bulk structure.
- **trajectory** (`TrajectoryData`): Contains positions, velocities, and forces over the relaxation steps.
- **energies** (`ArrayData`): Total energies at each step of the relaxation.
- **forces** (`ArrayData`): Forces acting on each atom during relaxation.
- **kpoints** (`KpointsData`): The k-point mesh used in the calculation.
- **misc** (`Dict`): Miscellaneous information related to the relaxation, such as convergence parameters.
- **remote_folder** (`RemoteData`): Directory where the calculations were performed.
- **retrieved** (`FolderData`): Retrieved output files from the calculations.

### 2. Slab Relaxations

Multiple symmetric slab terminations are generated from the bulk structure based on the specified Miller indices. Each slab represents a different possible surface configuration of the material. Each slab is then relaxed to find its minimum energy configuration. The number of slabs (`ST_1`, `ST_2`, ...) depends on the material's symmetry and possible terminations.

For each slab termination, the outputs include:

- **structure** (`StructureData`): The relaxed slab structure, containing the atomic positions and cell parameters after relaxation.
- **trajectory** (`TrajectoryData`): Contains detailed information about the relaxation process of the slab.
- **energies** (`ArrayData`): Total energies at each step of the slab relaxation.
- **forces** (`ArrayData`): Forces acting on each atom during slab relaxation.
- **kpoints** (`KpointsData`): The k-point mesh used in the slab calculation.
- **misc** (`Dict`): Additional information from the relaxation process, such as stress tensors and convergence details.
- **remote_folder** (`RemoteData`): The directory on the remote computer where the calculation was performed, useful for accessing raw data if needed.
- **retrieved** (`FolderData`): The files retrieved from the calculation, including output logs, charge densities, and other relevant data.

These outputs allow you to analyze the relaxed structures of different slab terminations and compare their properties.

### 3. Stable Structures

After relaxing all slab terminations, the work chain identifies the most thermodynamically stable surface terminations based on calculated surface energies. These stable structures are critical for understanding surface phenomena and predicting material behavior under various conditions.

For each identified stable slab (`relax_slab_1`, `relax_slab_2`, ...), the outputs are:

- **structure** (`StructureData`): The relaxed stable slab structure, representing the most energetically favorable configuration.
- **trajectory** (`TrajectoryData`): Contains detailed information about the relaxation process of the stable slab.
- **energies** (`ArrayData`): Total energies at each step of the stable slab relaxation.
- **forces** (`ArrayData`): Forces acting on each atom during the relaxation of the stable slab.
- **kpoints** (`KpointsData`): The k-point mesh used in the stable slab calculation.
- **misc** (`Dict`): Detailed information from the relaxation and analysis, including surface energy calculations and relevant thermodynamic quantities.
- **remote_folder** (`RemoteData`): The directory where the stable slab calculations were performed.
- **retrieved** (`FolderData`): Retrieved files from the calculation, which may include data specific to surface thermodynamics analysis.

### 4. Generated Plots for Surface Gibbs Free Energies vs. Chemical Potentials

#### For Binary Oxides (e.g., Agâ‚‚O)

For binary oxides, a plot is generated showing the **Surface Gibbs free energy (Î³) as a function of the chemical potential of oxygen (Î”Î¼_O)**. This plot helps visualize how changes in the chemical potential of oxygen affect surface stability.

The generated plot is saved in the directory `thermo_results/binary`.

Additionally, a LaTeX table is generated that contains the parameters used for calculating the surface Gibbs free energy. The table provides transparency regarding the specific parameters used in the main equation, including:

- **Termination**: The termination label.
- **$E_{slab}$ (eV)**: The energy of the slab.
- **$N_{element}$**: The number of atoms of the first element in the slab.
- **$N_O$**: The number of oxygen atoms in the slab.
- **$A$ (Ã…Â²)**: The surface area of the slab.

The LaTeX table is saved as `thermo_results/binary/termination_parameters_table.tex`. This table is useful if you want to create your own plots.

#### For Ternary Oxides (e.g., Agâ‚‚MoOâ‚„)

For ternary oxides, two plots are generated:

- **Surface Gibbs free energy (Î³) vs. chemical potential of oxygen (Î”Î¼_O)**: Similar to the binary oxide case, this plot shows the relationship between the surface Gibbs free energy and the variation in the chemical potential of oxygen.
- **Surface Phase Diagram**: This plot shows the variation of the chemical potential of the first element (e.g., Ag, Î”Î¼_Ag) and the variation of the chemical potential of oxygen (Î”Î¼_O). The most stable surface terminations are identified in this diagram, providing insights into how both elements contribute to surface stability under different conditions.

The generated plots are saved in the directory `thermo_results/ternary`.

Additionally, a LaTeX table is generated that contains the parameters used for calculating the surface Gibbs free energy for ternary oxides. The table provides transparency regarding the specific parameters used in the main equation, including:

- **Termination**: The label of the termination.
- **Number of Atoms**: The number of atoms of each element in the slab.
- **Î˜**: Represents the difference in energy between the slab total energy and the reference energies.

The LaTeX table is saved as `thermo_results/ternary/termination_parameters_table.tex`. This table is useful if you want to create your own plots.

### Common Output Descriptions

For all categories above, the outputs are stored in consistent AiiDA node types:

- **structure** (`StructureData`): The relaxed structure (bulk or slab).
- **trajectory** (`TrajectoryData`): Contains positions, velocities, and forces over the relaxation steps.
- **energies** (`ArrayData`): Total energies at each step of the relaxation.
- **forces** (`ArrayData`): Forces acting on each atom during relaxation.
- **kpoints** (`KpointsData`): The k-point mesh used in the calculation.
- **misc** (`Dict`): Additional data and metadata from the relaxation process.
- **remote_folder** (`RemoteData`): The directory on the remote computer where calculations were performed.
- **retrieved** (`FolderData`): The files retrieved from the remote calculation, including output data necessary for analysis.

These outputs provide all the essential information required for further thermodynamic analyses, such as calculating surface Gibbs free energies and constructing phase diagrams. The consistent structure of the outputs ensures that they can be easily accessed and processed, regardless of the specific material or the number of slabs generated.
